# Network-Managment


1. Introduction to the project 
1.1 Existing System & Its Drawbacks
	Network Management managing & configuring  are one of the most overlooked virtual activities in today's digital age. Various companies are constantly adding new features to note-taking and password management.
So, instead of having and maintaining two different apps in your system, we'll be developing
a single app that can perform both of these activities.
 
1.2 Purpose(need) of System 
	Network Management managing & note-taking are one of the most overlooked virtual activities in today's digital age. Various companies are constantly adding new features to note-taking and password management.
So, instead of having and maintaining two different apps in your system, we'll be developing
a single app that can perform both of these activities.

2. Proposed System 
2.1 Problem statement’s
Instead of having and maintaining two different apps in your system, we'll be developing a single app that can perform both of these activities.





2.2 Objectives of the proposed system
a. Objective of the proposed system is to provide an automated application to perform different   functionalities which can overcome the manual efforts of users.
b. Proposed system includes functionalities like maintaining Two Applications for Note making & for Password.
c. Proposed system is more reliable in terms of data storage and maintenance as it has a database as a storage device.
d. It also includes functionalities that can help users to keep all Passwords safe.

2.3 Project Overview. (Functionality of Modules) 
The proposed system includes below mentioned functionalities and modules –
User-specific login and application flow
 	
This system provides two different user interfaces i.e., Notes & Passwords.
 	
Notes include adding Notes, Managing Notes.
 	
Passwords include creating a new auto password, saving the password, manage passwords.






2.4 Functional requirements
Login Module:
Introduction: Authorized users are allowed to access.
Input: User enters the User Id and password.
Process Definition: Checks User Id and password are valid or not.
Output: The user is directed to the next page or shows the message box “Login Failed”.


Registration module:
Introduction: Only Admin can access the page.
Input: Admin has the authority to provide username and password for new employees.
Process Definition: Checks the same username and password exist or not and also checks whether all the fields are entered. 
Output: Employee gets the username and password.

Simple report graphs module:
Introduction: .
Input: note_id ,note.
Process Definition: checks whether all the fields are entered and save the information in the database.
Output: Notes get a unique identification number and a note will be created.

Add Device module:
Introduction: The user can create a Password
Input: password_Id, title, password.
Process Definition: Only the User can Create or Save a Password in the Database.
Output: Password gets a unique identification number and a password will be created or saved.

Show device information module:
Introduction: The user can Open saved Notes.
Process Definition: Here users can open the saved notes.
Output: A user opens saved notes.

Show logs module:
Introduction: The user can Generate random passwords.
Process Definition: Here users can Generate a random password of 12 words.
Output: A user Generates a random password of 12 words.


2 Nonfunctional requirements
→ High Availability
Obviously, it should also have high availability because the system should not go down no matter what happens.
 
→ No Lag
There should be no lag as it needs to be a real-time system where one could send and receive messages instantly.
 
→ Scale
Now, let’s design a system that can deliver all of these functional requirements with very low latency and a good scale.
 
3 Hardware Configuration 
Processor: Intel dual-core or above
Processor Speed:1.0GHZ or above
RAM: 1 GB RAM or above
Hard Disk: 20 GB hard disk or above
Software Environment 
Language: Python,Javascript,html
Database: Django Database, MYSQL

4. Future scope of the project 
	This project can be enhanced further by developing more functionalities. We are looking forward to upgrading this software by adding flows for password change reminders, and voice notes. The software is flexible enough to be modified and implemented as per future requirements.

5. Conclusion
	Notes and Password System comes up with the actual working of a Notepad and Password Management, where Notepad is a common text-only editor. The resulting files-typically saved with the .txt extension- have no format tags or styles, making the program suitable for editing system files. The software is flexible enough to be modified and implemented as per user requirements. We have tried our best to make this system a free and user-friendly User. It is a timely and cost-effective solution to your Password Maintain problems which will make you Password Secure and make your job easier.
